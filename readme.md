# Marble Craze

A game for the Atari 2600 console inspired by Atari's Marble Madness and Labyrinth, the wooden maze game played with steel marbles. Includes simultaneous two player mode, 18 levels, background music, hidden areas.  The game is written in 6507 assembly and is notable for its innovative music driver and use of dual-paddle controllers for each player. Reading analog paddle controllers on the Atari 2600 takes away significant CPU time from graphics processing which made the game's display kernel design especially challenging.

## Playing The Game

Cartridges are available from [Atariage](https://atariage.com/software_page.php?SoftwareID=3699) and the ROM (marblecr.bin) can be played on the Stella emulator or on real Atari 2600 hardware using a Harmony Cart or similar.  It is recommended to play the game with two real Atari paddle controllers since the game is very difficult with any other controller.


### Building From Source

I use the [DASM assembler](http://dasm-dillon.sourceforge.net/) (old DOS/Win version is included) to build the game, and there is also a C program included in the project that helps assemble the level data from text files.  More info on assembly coming soon...
